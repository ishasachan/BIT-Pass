Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of the Degree of B. Tech

## Abstract

In the context of Birla Institute of Technology Mesra (BIT Mesra) Off-Campus Deoghar, a significant operational challenge is the manual entry-exit register process at the college gates. This process, which requires students to manually record their details such as name, roll number, hostel, room number, purpose, entry, and exit times, poses several inefficiencies and security concerns. To modernise and enhance security in this process, the "BIT Pass" project proposes an innovative solution.

The "BIT Pass" project aims to automate and optimise the entry and exit management system at BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar. This will be achieved through the development of two applications: one for students and one for guards/administrators. The student application will allow users to register and sign in, providing them with the capability to log their entry and exit using a QR code-based system. On the other hand, the guard/administrator application will facilitate the generation of dynamic QR codes and provide oversight of the entry-exit data.

The core objective is to streamline and secure the entry-exit process, eliminating manual data entry while enhancing security through dynamic QR code generation. Additionally, the project aims to provide user-friendly interfaces for both students and guards/administrators, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.

This project signifies a transformative step towards enhancing security, efficiency, and user experience within the BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar community, fostering a digital-driven environment.

## Introduction

In the digital era, the administration of academic institutions faces evolving challenges. At Birla Institute of Technology Mesra (BIT Mesra) Off-Campus Deoghar, one such challenge is the management of the entry and exit of students through manual registers at college gates. This conventional system demands students to manually record various details upon entry and exit, resulting in inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and security vulnerabilities.

Imagine a future where this process becomes automated and secure. "BIT Pass" envisions this transformation by proposing an innovative solution. The project seeks to revolutionise the entry and exit management system by introducing two applications: one for students and one for guards/administrators.

The student application will empower users to register, sign in, and streamline their entry and exit through a QR code-based system. Conversely, the guard/administrator application will facilitate dynamic QR code generation and enable oversight of entry-exit data. This initiative aligns with the overarching goal of making BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar a technologically advanced and secure institution.

## Problem Definition

At BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar, the manual entry-exit register system presents multifaceted challenges. This outdated process is prone to errors, time-consuming, and poses security risks. Students, who are required to manually provide their details, often face inconveniences, and the institution is exposed to the possibility of data inaccuracies and unauthorised entries.

The need for modernization and security enhancement is evident. "BIT Pass" identifies these issues and addresses them by proposing a digital transformation. The project aims to replace the manual process with a digital entry-exit system, reducing errors and improving security. The project's primary goal is to provide a tailored solution to BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar's unique entry-exit management requirements.

"BIT Pass" envisions a future where students can seamlessly log their entry and exit through a secure QR code-based system, simplifying processes and enhancing security.

## Objectives

The "BIT Pass" project has several key objectives:

1. **Automation:** Develop a student application that automates the entry and exit process through QR code-based technology.

2. **Security Enhancement:** Improve the security of the entry-exit system by eliminating manual data entry and introducing dynamic QR codes.

3. **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for both students and guards/administrators to ensure a seamless experience.

4. **Efficiency:** Streamline the entry-exit process to save time and reduce errors.

5. **Data Oversight:** Provide guards/administrators with a tool to oversee and manage entry-exit data efficiently.

6. **Modernization:** Bring BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar's entry-exit system in line with current technological advancements.

## Proposed Work/Model

The "BIT Pass" project will consist of two distinct applications: one for students and another for guards/administrators. These applications will be built using the Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility. The backend will be developed using Node.js and Express.js.

### Student Application:

- User Registration and Sign-In
- QR Code Scanning for Entry and Exit
- Data Submission and Storage

### Guard/Administrator Application:

- User Authentication
- Dynamic QR Code Generation
- Data Management and Oversight

### IoT Integration:

A pivotal component of the "BIT Pass" project is the integration of an IoT (Internet of Things) device, specifically, a QR code generator screen installed at the college gates. This IoT device plays a critical role in ensuring the security and effectiveness of the entry-exit system.

**Key Functions of the IoT Device:**

- Dynamic QR Code Generation: The IoT device generates random and unique QR codes for each student entry.
- Secure Communication: It communicates securely with the applications to ensure data integrity and prevent misuse.
- Enhanced Security: By providing one-time-use QR codes, the IoT device minimises the risk of unauthorised entry.

## Conclusion

"BIT Pass" is an ambitious project designed to modernise and secure the entry and exit management system at BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar. By automating the process, introducing QR code-based technology, and providing user-friendly interfaces, the project aims to enhance security, efficiency, and user experience.

This initiative embodies the spirit of innovation and aligns with BIT Mesra Off-Campus Deoghar's commitment to technological advancement. "BIT Pass" aspires to create a digital-driven environment that simplifies administrative processes while bolstering security.
